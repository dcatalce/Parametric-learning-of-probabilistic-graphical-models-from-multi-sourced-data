# Parametric-learning-of-probabilistic-graphical-models-from-multi-sourced-data
Master Project: Fundamental Principles of Data Science (UB)

In order to obtain the results from experiments 1-3 the "multi_source_methods.ipynb" has to be run, there are some instructions on how to obtain the exact results for the two datasets we analyze in this project.

The notebook follows the same order as the experiments in the pdf.

The files "uplaod_files","Metrics.py", "fit_hierarchical.py", "utils-py", "predict.py" and "VB.py" are used in all 3 experiments. They are used to uload the files that can be found in the folder "Datasets", estimate the models and do the evaluation of the models for the three experiments carried out in the project:

* Experiment 1: sample size
* Experiment 2: Divergence in distributions
* Experiment 3: Sample size + divergence in distributions

The file "diverge_distribution.py" is only used in the second and third experiment to create synthetic data.
